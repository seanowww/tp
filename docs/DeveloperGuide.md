## 1. Introduction

This Developer Guide describes the architecture, design, and implementation details of **ClubTrack**, a desktop app for university club executives to manage members, track attendance, and award participation points quickly via a CLI-first workflow.

ClubTrack is adapted from **AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)** but extended with:

- compulsory `yearOfStudy` and `faculty` for members,
- attendance and points tracking,
- **switchable member lists** (each backed by its own JSON file),
- clearer separation between `find` (name-only, substring) and `search` (tag-prefix),
- updated UI (`PersonCard`) to display points and academic info,
- tighter validation on phone numbers (SG mobile: 8 digits, start with 8 or 9),
- updated tests to match the new constraints.

This guide assumes you are familiar with **Java 17**, **JavaFX**, **Gradle**, and the **AB3 architecture**.

---

## 2. Architecture

ClubTrack follows the classic AB3 4-layer architecture:

1. **UI** – shows data and accepts commands.
2. **Logic** – parses and executes commands.
3. **Model** – holds in-memory data and exposes filtered lists to UI.
4. **Storage** – reads/writes JSON files to disk.

The entry point is `MainApp`. On startup it:

1. loads config / user prefs;
2. initialises storage;
3. creates the model;
4. creates the logic; and
5. hands control to the UI.

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

### 2.1 Architectural Extension: Switchable Lists

In AB3, storage always pointed to **one** file (`addressbook.json`).

In ClubTrack, storage can point to **different files** depending on the **active list name**. The default file is:

```tex
data/ClubTrack.json
````

Whenever the user runs:

```tex
switch Training_2025_10_20
```

the app starts reading/writing:

```tex
data/Training_2025_10_20.json
```

All **mutating** commands (`add`, `edit`, `present`, `absent`, `clear`, `addpoints`, `minuspoints`, …) save to **the file of the currently active list**.

This keeps the architecture the same as AB3, but with an extra “current file” concept held by the Model/Storage.

---

## 3. UI Component

The UI layer is JavaFX-based and largely follows AB3.

**Main classes:**

* `UiManager` – entry point to the UI.
* `MainWindow` – top-level container; holds the command box, result display, status bar, and member list.
* `PersonListPanel` – shows the current list of members **for the active file**.
* `PersonCard` – shows:

    * name
    * **address**
    * **year of study** (e.g. `Y2`)
    * **faculty** (e.g. `School of Computing`)
    * phone
    * email
    * **Points: X**
    * tags

![UI Class Diagram](diagrams/UiClassDiagram.png)

**Why this change?**

Because we made `y/` and `f/` compulsory at the parser level, the UI can safely render them without guessing defaults. Points are shown explicitly to help exco track participation.

When the model reloads a different list (due to `switch`), the observable list changes and the UI automatically refreshes.

---

## 4. Logic Component

The **Logic** component is responsible for:

1. receiving the raw command string from the UI,
2. parsing it using `AddressBookParser`,
3. creating the corresponding `Command`,
4. executing it on the `Model`,
5. saving through `Storage` if the command mutates data, and
6. returning a `CommandResult`.

![Logic Class Diagram](diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.1 Command Execution

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions inside the Logic component when executing a `delete` command. It shows how a user command string flows through the parsing layer to create a `Command` object, which is then executed to interact with the `Model` component.

![Logic Sequence Diagram](diagrams/LogicSequenceDiagram.png)

**Flow:**
1. An external call to `LogicManager.execute("delete 2")` begins the process.
2. `LogicManager` delegates parsing to `ClubTrackParser.parseCommand("delete 2")`.
3. `ClubTrackParser` identifies the command word (`delete`) and creates the appropriate parser (`DeleteCommandParser`), which implements the `Parser` interface.
4. The `DeleteCommandParser` parses the argument (`"2"`) and instantiates a new `DeleteCommand` object with the parsed index.
5. The command object is returned to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `execute()` on the `DeleteCommand`, which invokes `deletePerson(2)` on the `Model`.
7. The `Model` performs the deletion, constructs a `CommandResult` object to represent the outcome, and returns it to `LogicManager`.
8. `LogicManager` returns the `CommandResult` to the caller (e.g., the UI).

This interaction pattern is consistent across all commands — every command goes through the same **parse → create → execute → result** cycle.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Key classes involved:**
- `LogicManager` — main orchestrator that executes user commands.
- `ClubTrackParser` — determines which parser to use based on the command word.
- `Parser` (interface) — defines the `parse(String args)` method.
- `DeleteCommandParser` — concrete parser that extracts the argument and constructs `DeleteCommand`.
- `Command` (abstract) — base class for all executable user commands.
- `CommandResult` — encapsulates the output of command execution.
- `Model` — the data layer that performs the actual operation (e.g., delete, add).

**Design intent:**
This structure cleanly separates concerns between **command parsing**, **command execution**, and **data management**, allowing new commands to be added with minimal coupling.

---

### 4.2 Parser Class Diagram

The diagram below provides a detailed view of the **Parser layer**, showing how user input is transformed into executable `Command` objects.

![Parser Class Diagram](diagrams/ParserClassDiagram.png)

**Description:**

* `ClubTrackParser` serves as the **entry point** for all command strings.
  It identifies the command word and delegates parsing to the appropriate command-specific parser (represented collectively as `XYZCommandParser`).
* Each command parser (e.g. `AddCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, `SwitchCommandParser`, `SearchCommandParser`) implements the `Parser` interface and follows a consistent structure:
  tokenize → extract arguments → validate → create the corresponding `Command`.
* `XYZCommandParser` represents all individual command parsers in simplified form for clarity.
* `CliSyntax`, `Prefix`, `ArgumentTokenizer`, and `ArgumentMultimap` form the utility layer that handles prefix-based argument extraction (e.g. `n/`, `p/`, `t/`).
* `ParserUtil` provides static helper methods for validating and converting parsed strings into domain model objects (e.g. `Name`, `Tag`, `Faculty`).

**Key relationships:**

* `ClubTrackParser` **creates** the relevant parser (`XYZCommandParser`) based on the user input.
* Each parser **creates** a `Command` after successful parsing.
* `ParserUtil`, `ArgumentTokenizer`, and `ArgumentMultimap` are **used** across all parsers for argument processing.
* `CliSyntax` and `Prefix` **define** the shared command prefix structure used by all parsers.

**Design intent:**
This modular parser design ensures **extensibility**—adding a new command only requires:

1. Implementing a new `*CommandParser` that adheres to the `Parser` interface, and
2. Registering it in `ClubTrackParser`.

This design promotes **low coupling**, **code reuse**, and **consistent parsing behavior** across all commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 5. Model Component

The **Model** layer keeps the application state and provides observable lists to the UI.

![Model Class Diagram](diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**Main responsibilities:**

* hold the current `AddressBook` (for the active list),
* expose `FilteredList<Person>` for UI,
* remember the **active list name** (e.g. `ClubTrack`, `Training_2025_10_20`),
* hold user preferences.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.1 Person model

We extended AB3’s `Person` to include club-specific and attendance fields:

```tex
Person
 ├─ name : Name
 ├─ phone : Phone           // 8 digits, start with 8 or 9
 ├─ email : Email
 ├─ address : Address       // shown on card
 ├─ yearOfStudy : int       // 1..5
 ├─ faculty : String        // non-empty
 ├─ tags : Set<Tag>
 ├─ isPresent : boolean     // for attendance
 └─ points : Points         // value object
```

We also changed **identity**:

* **Before (AB3):** name-based
* **Now:** **same person = same email OR same phone**

    * lets us store multiple people with the same name
    * it still guards against accidental duplicates using contact info

`Points` is implemented as a small value object to make it easy to reason about add/subtract operations.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 6. Storage Component

The Storage layer reads/writes JSON using the usual AB3 JSON storage classes, but with an extra concept: **active list name = file name**.

![Storage Class Diagram](diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**Behaviour:**

* On startup, we try to read:

  ```tex
  data/ClubTrack.json
  ```

  If it does not exist, we create it with a sample ClubTrack dataset.

* When the user runs:

  ```tex
  switch CCA_Showcase
  ```

  we from then on read/write:

  ```tex
  data/CCA_Showcase.json
  ```

* `clear` only clears the **currently loaded** address book, and then saves it back to **the same file**.

This design keeps lists isolated. Each event/training/day can have its own file, but the rest of the architecture is unchanged.

---

## 7. Feature Implementation

### 7.1 `switch` feature

**Goal:** let exco maintain multiple independent member/attendance lists (e.g. Week 1 training, production night, ad-hoc event) without mixing data.

**Command format:**

```tex
switch LIST_NAME
```

**Flow:**

1. `LogicManager` parses `LIST_NAME`.
2. `Model` is told to “activate” that list.
3. `Storage` tries to load `data/LIST_NAME.json`:

    * if present → load
    * if missing → create a new empty address book, save as `data/LIST_NAME.json`
4. UI refreshes because the model’s observable list changed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Activity diagram:**

![Switch Activity Diagram](diagrams/SwitchActivityDiagram.png)

**Design considerations:**

* We store the active list name in the model layer so that **all** mutating commands (add, edit, present, points, clear) can save to the correct file.
* We **reused** the same JSON structure from AB3 to minimise changes.
* This fits the CS2103T expectation that *clear should not unexpectedly wipe unrelated data.*

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 7.2 `add` command (updated)

**Old (AB3):** name, phone, email, **address** were compulsory; others optional.
**New (ClubTrack):** we keep **address** in the same position as AB3, then make **year of study** (`y/`) and **faculty** (`f/`) compulsory **after** address.

**New format (final):**

```tex
add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS y/YEAR_OF_STUDY f/FACULTY [t/TAG]...
```

**Validation:**

* `p/PHONE` → 8 digits, starts with 8 or 9
* `a/ADDRESS` → non-empty
* `y/` → integer 1–5
* `f/` → non-empty
* single-valued prefixes must not be repeated

**Why this order?**

* It stays close to AB3 (which markers/testers already know).
* We only **extended** the person with `y/` and `f/`, we did not reorder all existing prefixes.
* It keeps **User Guide** and **Developer Guide** consistent.

**Example:**

```tex
add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/johnd@example.com a/Blk 123, #02-01 y/2 f/School of Computing t/committee
```

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 7.3 `find` vs `search`

We deliberately split them to reduce PE bugs and to make behaviour easy to explain.

#### 7.3.1 `find`

* **Purpose:** quick lookup by **name only**
* **Behaviour:** case-insensitive **contains** on the *name* field
* **Does NOT** search tags, faculty, year, or address
* **Examples:**

  ```tex
  find john
  find alex david
  ```

  matches `John`, `Johnathan`, `Alex David`.

#### 7.3.2 `search`

* **Purpose:** structured filtering, especially **tag-based**
* **Behaviour:** tag **prefix** matching
* **Example:**

  ```tex
  search t/log
  ```

  matches people tagged `logistics`, `logiCore`, `log`, because the tag **starts with** `log`.

You may also supply a name component in the future, but for v1.5 the key is: **“find is for names; search is for tags.”**

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 7.4 Points features

We added a lightweight points system for participation:

* `addpoints INDEX pts/VALUE` – add `VALUE` to member’s points
* `minuspoints INDEX pts/VALUE` – subtract `VALUE`
* `points INDEX` – **show** member’s current points (does not edit)

This is model-only, so the UI just renders `Points: X` from the person.

---

## 8. Testing and Test Updates

Because we tightened phone validation **and** made `y/` + `f/` compulsory, several AB3 tests needed updating.

**What we changed:**

1. **Test constants**

    * `VALID_PHONE_AMY = "88888888"`
    * `VALID_PHONE_BOB = "99999999"`
    * Any other phone in test fixtures must be 8 digits starting with 8/9.

2. **Parser tests**

    * `AddCommandParserTest` must now include **both** `y/` and `f/` **and** keep the new prefix order: `a/` → `y/` → `f/`.
    * Duplicate-prefix tests must list `y/` and `f/` in the expected error where relevant.

3. **Storage-related tests**

    * In tests where we trigger an `add` to force a save (e.g. in `LogicManagerTest`), the input must now contain **all compulsory prefixes**:

      ```tex
      add n/Amy p/88888888 e/amy@example.com a/Blk 123 y/1 f/School of Computing
      ```

4. **Typical persons**

    * `TypicalPersons` → change phones to valid SG numbers.

This keeps test data aligned with the real rules users see in the UI/UG.

---

## 9. Editing the data file

ClubTrack stores data in:

```tex
[JAR location]/data/<listName>.json
```

* Default list:

  ```tex
  data/ClubTrack.json
  ```

* After `switch soccer` (or any other name):

  ```tex
  data/soccer.json
  ```

Advanced users may edit these JSON files manually.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** If the JSON is malformed or fields are missing, ClubTrack will start that list empty the next time it is loaded. Always back up your `data/` folder first.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 10. Product scope

### Target user profile:

* is part of a university club executive committee
* needs to manage a large roster of members across multiple events or lists
* prefers **desktop apps** for reliability and offline access
* types fast and prefers keyboard-driven workflows
* is comfortable using **Command Line Interface (CLI)** apps with structured commands
* wants to easily track attendance, points, and roles without using spreadsheets

### Value proposition:

ClubTrack enables club executives to **manage members, track attendance, and assign points up to 3× faster** than traditional spreadsheet-based solutions through an intuitive command-line interface optimized for power users.

* **Mainstream OS** – Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Member Tag** – a label assigned to members to categorise them (e.g. `treasurer`, `dance`, `freshie`).
* **CLI** – Command Line Interface.
* **Active list** – the currently selected member list; determines which JSON file is read/written.
* **Duty Roster** – schedule assigning tasks to members.
* **Normal conditions** – refers to running ClubTrack on a mainstream operating system (Windows 11, macOS 14, or Ubuntu 22.04) with Java 17 or above, on a typical university laptop (≥ 8 GB RAM, ≥ 2.5 GHz dual-core processor, SSD storage) while managing up to 500 members.
* **Typical user** – a club executive or secretary familiar with basic computer use and able to type at an average speed of around 60 words per minute.
* **Common operations** – frequently used commands such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `find`, `list`, and `switch`.

## Appendix A – Instructions for Manual Testing

### A.1 Launch and shutdown

1. Ensure you have Java 17.
2. Run `java -jar ClubTrack.jar`.
3. Verify that the respective JSON save file is created after making a change to the data.
4. Close the window → app should exit cleanly.

### A.2 Adding a member

**Input:**

```tex
add n/Amy Bee p/88888888 e/amy@example.com a/Blk 123 y/2 f/School of Computing
```

**Expected:**

* A new card appears with:

    * name “Amy Bee”
    * address shown
    * `Y2 - School of Computing`
    * phone `88888888`
    * `Points: 0`

**Error case:**

```tex
add n/Bob p/123 e/bob@example.com a/Tampines y/2 f/SOC
```

Expected: error about phone constraints.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### A.3 Switching lists

1. Run:

   ```tex
   switch Training_2025_10_20
   ```

2. Expected:

    * status message says list switched / created
    * list view becomes empty (for a new list)

3. Add someone here:

   ```tex
   add n/John p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/UTown y/1 f/SoC
   ```

4. Switch back:

   ```tex
   switch default
   ```

   Expected: you see the original list.
   Switch again to `Training_2025_10_20` → John is still there.

### A.4 Searching

1. Add a person with tag `Logistics` and one with tag `LogiCore`.

2. Run:

   ```tex
   search t/log
   ```

   Expected: both appear (prefix match).

3. Run:

   ```tex
   find log
   ```

   Expected: **does not** return them unless “log” appears in their **name**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### A.5 Clearing current list

1. Switch to a test list:

   ```tex
   switch TestList
   add n/Test p/91234567 e/test@example.com a/Biz y/1 f/SoC
   clear
   ```

2. Expected: current list becomes empty; other lists are **not** affected.

## Appendix B – Effort

**Team size:** 5

1. **What was harder than AB3?**

    * Implementing **switchable member lists**, each backed by its own JSON file, without breaking AB3’s single-file storage design.
    * Enforcing **compulsory fields (`y/`, `f/`)** required deep changes across parsers, model classes, and test utilities.
    * Enhancing **validation rules** (e.g. stricter phone and email formats) that invalidated large portions of inherited AB3 test data.
    * Maintaining **data consistency** and auto-save behaviour when switching between lists — required careful model–storage synchronization.

2. **What we reused:**

    * AB3’s **Command → Parser → Model → Storage** architectural pattern.
    * AB3’s **diagram conventions** and documentation layout for visual clarity.
    * AB3’s **JUnit test scaffolding** for command and parser testing.

3. **What we added:**

    * **`SwitchCommand`** and supporting model state to enable seamless switching between multiple club rosters.
    * **Persistent points and attendance tracking**, including updated UI and storage integration.
    * **Enhanced tag and search system** with prefix-based filtering for roles (e.g. `committee`, `exco`).
    * **Refined UI layout** showing key fields (year, faculty, points) and dynamic updates after each command.
    * **Improved parser utilities** to handle stricter validation.

## Appendix C – Planned Enhancements

**Team size:** 5

1. **List existing lists**
   Since we now create JSON files on demand, users should be able to run something like `lists` to see available roster files.

2. **Email validation extension**
   Update validation to accept the special character '+' in the local-part to match standard email formats.

3. **Role-based tags**
   Some tags are “roles” (President, Secretary). We can display them differently in the UI.

4. **Import from CSV**
   Many clubs keep members in Google Sheets. A CSV import would reduce data entry.

5. **Support for non-Singapore phone numbers**
   Currently only 8-digit local numbers (starting with 8 or 9) are allowed. We plan to extend validation to include international formats (e.g., +60, +65, +91).

6. **Allow `/` in member names**
   Certain legal names include slashes (e.g., “S/O John Doe”). We will enhance `Name` validation to support these characters safely.

7. **Input validation for duplicate faculty fields**
   Editing a member with multiple `f/` prefixes silently keeps the latest. We plan to detect duplicates and show a proper error message.

8. **Input validation for duplicate year fields**
   Similar to faculty, multiple `y/` prefixes during edit or add should trigger an error instead of overwriting the last value.

9. **Strict date validation for invalid calendar dates**
   Currently, invalid dates like 31/11/2025 are silently adjusted to the nearest valid date (30/11/2025) due to Java’s lenient date parsing. We plan to enable strict validation using ResolverStyle.STRICT so that impossible dates trigger a clear error message instead of being auto-corrected.

10. **Prevent directory traversal in list names**
    Lists with ../ in their names can delete files outside the app folder. Future versions will block such inputs to prevent unauthorized file access.
